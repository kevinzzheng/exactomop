## 🧪 Expected Safety Metrics

When safety scores are computed, you should see approximately:

| Trial Arm | Expected Score | Risk Level | Reason |
|-----------|---------------|------------|--------|
| **1004** (TCH Standard) | ~100.0 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ LOW | No adverse events |
| **1005** (Control) | ~90-95 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ LOW | Few mild events |
| **1003** (TCHP) | ~80-85 | ⭐⭐⭐ MODERATE | Some G3 events (cardiotoxicity) |
| **1001** (AC-T) | ~70-75 | ⭐⭐ ELEVATED | Multiple G3/G4 events |
| **1002** (FEC-T) | ~60-65 | ⭐ HIGH | G4 event + multiple SAEs |

**Note**: Exact scores depend on the `SAFETY_WEB_THRESHOLD` setting (default: 15.0)

## 🔬 Advanced Testing Use Cases

### Test Case 1: WEB Calculation
Verify Weighted Event Burden formula:
```python
arm = TrialArm.objects.get(pk=1001)
metrics = arm.safety_metrics.latest('computation_date')
# Expected: WEB = (1 × e1_2) + (10 × e3_4) + (100 × e5)
```

### Test Case 2: EAIR Calculation
Verify Event-Adjusted Incidence Rate:
```python
# EAIR = patients_with_any_AE / person_years
# person_years = (n_patients × follow_up_months) / 12
```

### Test Case 3: Multiple Grades Per Patient
Test proper patient uniqueness:
- Patient 2001: Has both G1 and G2 events
- Should count once in e1_2_count

### Test Case 4: Event Resolution Tracking
Test outcome patterns:
- Some events: `resolution_date = null` (ongoing)
- Most events: Resolved with appropriate durations

### Test Case 5: SAE Reporting Requirements
Verify reporting escalation:
```python
saes = AdverseEvent.objects.filter(serious=True)
# All G3+ should be serious
# All serious should have appropriate reporting flags
```

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Data

The synthetic adverse events integrate seamlessly with:

### Existing Patient Data
- Uses person_ids 2001-2015 from `synthetic_breast_cancer_patients.json`
- Events align with treatment regimen timelines
- AE dates correspond to treatment cycles

### OMOP Vocabulary
- Reuses existing concept framework
- Adds 10 new AE-specific SNOMED concepts
- Maintains vocabulary standards

### Treatment Context
- Events occur during documented treatment lines
- Trial arms represent actual regimens used
- Maintains clinical coherence
