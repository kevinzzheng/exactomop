### Adverse Events Distribution

- **Total Adverse Events**: 30
- **Grade 1 (Mild)**: 8 events
- **Grade 2 (Moderate)**: 11 events  
- **Grade 3 (Severe)**: 9 events
- **Grade 4 (Life-threatening)**: 2 events
- **Grade 5 (Death)**: 0 events
- **Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)**: 11 events

### Key Findings

1. **Highest Risk**: AC-T Chemotherapy arm (Score: 25.00)
   - Multiple Grade 3-4 events including febrile neutropenia
   - High WEB score due to severe adverse events

2. **Safest Arm**: TCH Standard arm (Score: 100.00)
   - No adverse events reported
   - Completed trial with clean safety profile

3. **Control Arm**: Standard of Care (Score: 88.24)
   - Only mild Grade 1-2 events
   - Demonstrates baseline safety profile

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Safety Scoring Algorithm

The system uses three key metrics:

1. **WEB (Weighted Event Burden)**:
   - Formula: `WEB = 1 × (G1-2) + 10 × (G3-4) + 100 × (G5)`
   - Higher WEB = Higher risk

2. **EAIR (Event-Adjusted Incidence Rate)**:
   - Formula: `EAIR = (Patients with events) / (Person-years)`
   - Higher EAIR = Higher event frequency

3. **Safety Score**:
   - Formula: `Safety Score = 100 / (1 + WEB/H)`
   - Where H = WEB threshold (default: 15.0)
   - Range: 0-100 (higher = safer)

### Risk Categories

- **LOW_RISK**: Score ≥ 70
- **ELEVATED_RISK**: Score 50-69  
- **HIGH_RISK**: Score < 50

## 🎯 Key Insights

1. **Safety Score Effectiveness**: The scoring system successfully differentiates between high-risk (AC-T: 25.00) and low-risk (TCH Standard: 100.00) trial arms.

2. **Grade Weighting**: The WEB calculation properly weights severe events (Grade 3-4) 10x higher than mild events, reflecting clinical significance.

3. **Person-Time Adjustment**: EAIR provides event frequency adjusted for follow-up time, enabling fair comparison across trials.

4. **Risk Categorization**: The three-tier risk system (LOW/ELEVATED/HIGH) provides clear clinical decision support.

5. **API Integration**: RESTful API enables easy integration with frontend applications and external systems.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Customization**: Adjust `SAFETY_WEB_THRESHOLD` in settings.py to modify sensitivity
2. **Integration**: Use React/Vue components in your frontend application
3. **Extension**: Add more adverse event types or modify scoring algorithms
4. **Production**: Deploy with real clinical trial data (ensure proper data governance)
